# SuperRes AI: 4x Image Super-Resolution with Deep Residual Networks

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

**SuperRes AI** is a deep learning project developed for the **CSE445 Machine Learning** course at **North South University**. The project implements a powerful super-resolution model to restore high-resolution (256x256) images from low-resolution (64x64) inputs, achieving a 4x upscale factor.

## 📌 Project Overview

</div>

The core objective of this project is to build and train an **EDSR-like (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution)** model capable of intelligently reconstructing high-frequency details lost during image degradation. Unlike traditional algorithms like Bicubic interpolation, our model learns from a dataset of image pairs to produce visually superior and more accurate results.

The system features an automated data preparation pipeline, a robust deep learning model, and a comprehensive evaluation framework for both quantitative and qualitative assessment.

## 🚀 Key Features

</div>

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: A standalone Python script (`1_prepare_dataset.py`) automates the entire data preparation process. It takes raw high-resolution images, creates a 60/20/20 train-validation-test split, and generates the corresponding low-resolution (64x64) and high-resolution (256x256) pairs.
- **EDSR-like Architecture**: Implements a powerful deep learning model inspired by the EDSR paper, utilizing a series of residual blocks to enable deep feature learning and stable training.
- **Efficient Upsampling**: Uses two sub-pixel convolution layers (`tf.nn.depth_to_space`) for efficient and high-quality 4x upsampling, minimizing checkerboard artifacts common in other methods.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated both quantitatively using the **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** metric and qualitatively through side-by-side visual comparisons against the Bicubic baseline.
- **Data Augmentation**: To improve model generalization and performance on a limited dataset, the training pipeline automatically applies random horizontal flips and rotations to the training images.

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage

</div>

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd SuperResAI
````

**2. Create and Activate Conda Environment**
We recommend using Conda to manage dependencies. This project is built and tested with Python 3.10.

```bash
# Create a new environment named 'superres'
conda create --name superres python=3.10 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate superres
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r support/requirements.txt
```

**4. Add Original Images**
Place your high-resolution (e.g., 1024x1024) images inside the `data/raw/` directory.

**5. Run the Data Preparation Script**
Execute the script from the project's root directory. This will populate the train, val, and test folders.

```bash
python support/1_prepare_dataset.py
```

**6. Launch Jupyter Notebook and Train**
Start the Jupyter server from the project's root directory.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `SuperResolutionAnalysis.ipynb` notebook. If prompted, select the `superres` kernel. You can now run all the cells to train the model, evaluate its performance, and see the visual results. For best results, let the model train for 150+ epochs.
